### Step1. Installing extension to your VSCode

Search `vscode-coding-tracker` in VSCode extension panel and install it.

### Step2. Install and Launching tracker server in remote server or local

#### Local computer (controlled by VSCode)

You don't need to do anything.(And **don't** change the configuration `codingTracker.localServerMode` to `false`)

In this situation, the database files are located in `$HOME/.coding-tracker/`

#### Local computer (controlled by yourself)

0. Set your vscode configuration `codingTracker.localServerMode` to `false`
1. Open a terminal/command line
2. Change path to `%HOME%/.vscode/extensions/hangxingliu.vscode-coding-tracker-0.6.0`
	- In Windows OS, enter command: `cd %HOME%/.vscode/extensions/hangxingliu.vscode-coding-tracker-0.6.0`
	- In Linux/Mac OS, enter command: `cd $HOME/.vscode/extensions/hangxingliu.vscode-coding-tracker-0.6.0`
3. Execute `npm i`
4. Launch tracker server by using command: `npm start -- -t ${REPLACE_TO_YOUR_TOKEN}`
	- Such as `npm start -- -t test_token`, means your upload token is `test_token`
	- And you can get more configurations and descriptions by using command `npm start -- --help`
	- Be care! It is necessary to add `--` following to `npm start` to passing following arguments to tracker server
5. And your tracking data is under `./database` in default.

#### Remote server

0. Set your vscode configuration `codingTracker.localServerMode` to `false`
1. Login into your remote server
2. Be sure to install `node` and `npm` environments
3. Typing command `npm i vscode-coding-tracker-server` (Global install: append ` -g` to the command)
4. Launch tracker server by using command: `npm start -- -t ${REPLACE_TO_YOUR_TOKEN}`
5. And your tracking data is under `./database` in default.

### Step 3. Configuring the upload token and your server address in your VSCode

configurations:

- `codingTracker.serverURL` (set up such as "http://localhost:10345")
	- If you use local tracker server and use default config, you can ignore this config.
	- Because default value of this config is `http://localhost:10345` 
- `codingTracker.uploadToken` (set up such as "123456")
	- Setting up this value same as the token you launch your server
- `codingTracker.computerId` (set up this computer name then you can easy to know which computer you coding more time)
	- (Optional config)
- `codingTracker.localServerMode` (in default is true). Please refer above
- `codingTracker.moreThinkingTime` (in default is 0 ). More thinking time for tracking
	- This config is making for people need more thinking time in coding activity.
	- The bigger value you set the longer time you get in report time
	- **I don't recommend setting up this value bigger, Because I believe the default think time in extension is nice followed my usage**

### Step 4. See your report

Open command panel in your VSCode.Then search and click command `CodingTracker: Show your coding activities report`

Or, just open browser and enter `http://${YOUR_SERVER_HOST_NAME}:${PORT}/report/?token=${API_TOKEN}`

- Such as `http://127.0.0.1:10345/report/`
- Such as `http://mydomain.com:10345/report/?token=myUploadToken`

### More commands:

- `codingTracker.startLocalServer` 
- `codingTracker.stopLocalServer` 
- `codingTracker.showReport`
